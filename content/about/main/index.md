  Posts on this blog will demonstrate how to use rtichoke by reproducible examples. Some of the posts will be replications of existing codes that produce the same output as rtichoke by different packages. Other posts will be more focused on theoretical issues, but also with a reproducible piece of code.
  
  Talks might be about everything as long as there is some relevant outputs by rtichoke. Most of the talks will be in Hebrew but the slides will be in English.
